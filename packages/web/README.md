# @lametrader/web

Browser app for the lametrader platform — a Vite/React/TypeScript driving adapter that talks to the `@lametrader/api` REST + WebSocket surfaces behind an nginx `/api/*` proxy.

The shell (sidebar + topbar + theme + Radix Themes), the routing, the TanStack Query + `apiFetch` data layer, and the logging conventions are documented in [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) — read that first if you are extending the UI.

## Pages

### `/` — Watchlist

The home page: a dense, sortable table of the symbols you watch, each with its latest price and change.
Sort by symbol, type, price, or change.
Add a symbol by searching for an instrument, edit which timeframes it's tracked on, or remove it — each confirmed with a toast.
A symbol with no price yet shows a dash.

Backfill historical candles from a symbol's row actions (or right after adding it): pick periods and an optional date range, watch each job's live progress, and retry on failure.

Live price ticking lands in a separate task.

### `/chart` — Chart

A candlestick chart of one watched symbol on one timeframe, rendered with `lightweight-charts`.
The symbol and period live in the URL (`/chart?id=&period=&range=`), so a chart is shareable and the browser's back/forward buttons navigate between views; a bare `/chart` opens the first watched symbol on your last-selected period (falling back to the config default), or sends you to the watchlist when nothing is watched.
A top-left overlay shows the symbol summary (description · period · exchange) and the inspected candle's open/high/low/close, change, and volume — the candle under the crosshair, or the latest one otherwise.
A bottom action bar holds the symbol picker (a searchable dialog; instruments outside your watchlist appear faded and can't be charted) and the period + date-range dialog.
Crypto and equities get a volume sub-pane; FX (no volume) omits it.
Candle and volume colors follow the app theme and update live when you toggle it.
Scrolling back in time loads older history a window at a time until the start of what's stored; a symbol with no stored candles shows a "Run backfill" card that fetches history without leaving the page.
The visible date range and selected period persist (localStorage), so switching symbols and reloads keep your view.

Live candle ticks and indicator overlays land in follow-up issues.

### `/settings` — Settings (this README's focus)

Read/write the platform configuration (`GET` / `PUT /api/config`).

**Surface controls**

- **Periods** — a multi-select toggle bar (Radix Primitives `ToggleGroup`, `type=multiple`) rendered as a trading-platform timeframe bar: `1m 5m 15m 30m 1h 4h 1d 1w`.
  A pressed toggle = an enabled period.
- **Default period** — a Radix Themes `Select` whose options are only the **currently-enabled** periods.
  Toggling a period off in the bar removes it as a `defaultPeriod` option and clears the selection if the toggled-off period was the active default (mirrors `parseConfig`'s `defaultPeriod ∈ periods` rule for instant client feedback).
- **Save** — Radix Themes `Button`, disabled until the form is dirty.
  Submits the full payload via `PUT /api/config`.

**Validation**

The form reuses `@lametrader/core`'s `parseConfig` through a custom react-hook-form resolver (`src/lib/parse-config-resolver.ts`).
The same module the backend enforces — no zod, no client-side rule duplication.
A thrown `ConfigError` becomes a form-level error rendered inline as a Radix Themes `Callout`.

**Feedback**

- Success → a sonner toast (`Settings saved`).
- A server-rejected save (4xx with `{ error: string }`) → the server's message rendered inline as a `Callout color="red"` above the form footer.
- Initial-load failure → an inline `Callout` with the server message; the form is not rendered.
- Initial-load pending → a Radix Themes `Skeleton` placeholder.

## Hooks

`src/lib/hooks/use-config.ts` exposes:

- `useConfig()` — `GET /api/config` via TanStack Query under key `['config']`.
- `useUpdateConfig()` — `PUT /api/config`; on success, writes the response straight into the `['config']` cache so any subscriber re-renders without a follow-up round-trip.

`src/lib/hooks/symbols.ts` exposes the watchlist data layer (read the watched symbols, search instruments, add/edit-periods/remove).

`src/lib/hooks/candles.ts` exposes `usePagedCandles` — the chart's historical candle feed, which loads a symbol/period's bars a time window at a time and walks the window backward through history as you scroll.

Both modules go through the package's `apiFetch` wrapper, so logging + `ApiError` mapping happen at the boundary, not at each call site.

## Develop

```bash
# Dev server (Vite, port 5173, proxies /api → :3000)
npm run dev -w @lametrader/web

# Production build → packages/web/dist
npm run build -w @lametrader/web

# Type-check only (picked up by the root `npm run typecheck`)
npm run typecheck -w @lametrader/web

# Unit tests (component + hook tests in jsdom)
npm test
```

## Test tiers

- **Unit** — co-located `*.test.{ts,tsx}` next to the source. jsdom environment via the file-level `// @vitest-environment jsdom` directive.
  RTL `cleanup()` + `vi.restoreAllMocks()` in `afterEach`.
  Mock at the `fetch` boundary so the real `apiFetch` + `QueryClient` + RHF resolver are exercised.
- **E2E** — at the HTTP boundary, in `packages/api/tests/e2e/`.
  The settings page's contract is pinned by `packages/api/tests/e2e/settings-page.e2e.test.ts` (happy path + the 400 critical failure); the watchlist page's by `watchlist-page.e2e.test.ts` (the discover → add → enriched-list → edit → remove round-trip + the 404 failure); the chart page's by `chart-page.e2e.test.ts` (the backfill → windowed candle read + the empty-window state).
  No browser harness — page-level behaviour is covered by the unit tier.
